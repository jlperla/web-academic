A major direction in my research over the next few years is the investigation of new approaches to real financial frictions.  This includes applying computer-science/statistics style [learning and inference]({{< ref "/project/ML-high-dim/index.md" >}}) to models with [heterogeneity of information]({{< ref "/project/information-diffusion/index.md" >}}).

Along the way towards that goal, I have made some turns to investigate alternative stories such as the role of limited liability, incomplete markets, and commitment.
