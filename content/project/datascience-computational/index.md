I have a strong commitment to teaching data-science and computational methods to undergraduate and graduate students.  Part of this is through my work with [QuantEcon](quantecon.org) and the online textbooks [Quantitative Economics with Julia](julia.quantecon.org) and [QuantEcon DataScience](datascience.quantecon.org).
