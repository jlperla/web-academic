Not every top student should choose to get a masters or PhD in economics or finance - but if you want the option then some advanced preparation can make your life easier.

### Math and CS are Substitutes (and Complements)
Relative to older advice, I am increasing the importance of taking CS courses.  Don't be scared.  Anyone who might be interested in graduate school for economics or finance will do fine, and UBC CS grades fairly and so you won't be penalized for challenging yourself.

While the first misconception is that coding is difficult, another is to forget the "science" part of CS.  **CS $\neq$ coding**.  While there are elements of CS that are more engineering-centric, those aren't the courses you would take.  For our purposes, computer science is a rigorous mathematical science tightly connected to discrete-math, statistics, game theory, etc.

However, a word of warning: the 100 and 200 level classes are a lot more work than economics courses.  It is painful but time well spent, as there is no other way to build familiarity - but they grade fairly and generously, so there is no need to worry about your GPA.

### Goals for All
The most important advice I have is to take some mathematics and computing courses as soon as possible in your degree to open up other courses.  In particular, almost all economics majors who think they may be interested in grad school should take:
- **MATH 221 (Matrix Algebra)** .  This is a relatively easy math course for UBC, and linear/matrix algebra is essential for a lot of economics, finance, statistics, datascience, and machine learning.
  - This class will aid in you in a lot of your other economics courses and open up new classes (such as **ECON 408**).
- **CPSC 103 (Introduction to Systematic Program Design)** or **ECON323 (Quantitative Economic Modeling and Data Science)**.  It is essential to learn to "program" (i.e., the programming language doesn't really matter, just that it is a proper one and not simply R or Stata).
  - **CPSC 103** is a gentler introduction and leads to **CPSC 107** (which fulfills the same prerequisite as **CPSC 110**)
  - For students with more programming background and a capacity for more coursework you can try to take **CPSC 110** if they can, as it is a fast track to more electives.  It is a significant amount of coursework.
  - Otherwise, **ECON 323** is a easy entry to learning to code that uses more direct economics examples, which is fine for most economics majors but limits your ability to take CS electives.  Typically students would take **ECON 323** later in their degree.


### Suggested Courses
The most important advice I have is to take some mathematics and computing courses as soon as possible in your degree to open up other courses.  In particular, almost all economics majors who think they may be interested in grad school should take **MATH 221** and either **CPSC 103** or **ECON 323**.

But __if I were starting an undergrad__, some useful goals are to get **CPSC 340 (Machine Learning and Data Mining)** which requires a lot of courses intersection with math and CS and **ECON 425 (Advanced Econometrics)**.

In particular, my suggested math and CS courses (9 in total), to attain that are:
1. **CPSC 103 (Introduction to Systematic Program Design)** or jump to **CPSC 110 (Computation, Programs, and Programming)**: This is very approachable course in Python for anyone who hasn't coded before, and the CS department has outstanding undergrad course planning.  Fear not! Students with a stronger background and capacity for significant coursework can instead take **CPSC 110**.
2. **CPSC 107 (Systematic Program Design)** (unnecessary if you took **CPSC 110**): Very useful course, required for the next stage of prereqs.  Anyone who complains about using Scheme/Racket is missing the point of the course.
3. **MATH 221 (Matrix Algebra)**: Linear algebra is central to all sorts of problems in economics, statistics, and computer science.
4. **MATH 200 (Calculus III)**: This course is the worst.  Very little of it is directly useful for building rigor, but it is a prereq for many classes.
5. **MATH 220 (Mathematical Proof)**: Great class.  Builds rigor in logic and proofs you need in both economics and CS.
6. **CPSC 210 (Software Construction)**: The only real "coding" class here, which is necessary to build the capacity to handle more advanced courses.
7. **CPSC 221 (Basic Algorithms and Data Structures)**:  Teaches key proof techniques and discrete math you won't get in economics.
8. **MATH 302 (Introduction to Probability)**: A fun, extremely important class for both CS and economics.  Relatively easy grading for a math class.  or **STATS 302**
9. **CPSC 340 (Machine Learning and Data Mining)**: Great class teaching more of the fundamentals of ML.  Economists should learn this to truly understand these methods - but use them sparingly.  Strongly prefer this to **CPSC 330** which is more applications focused.  Enables some more advanced ML/AI courses

Then the economics classes which are good prep for graduate school
1. **ECON 307 (Honours Intermediate Macroeconomics II)**: In principal intended for honours students, but please take it if you have more technical preparation - especially __if you want grad school letters of reference from me__.
2. **ECON 326 (Introduction to Econometrics II)** or **ECON 328** for BIE or **STAT 306** for science majors.
3. **ECON 425 (Advanced Econometrics)**: A core course for graduate school preparation
4. **ECON 421 (Introduction to Game Theory and Applications)**: A core course for grad school preparation
5. **ECON 408 (Computational Methods in Macroeconomics)**: A new course I am teaching which brings together many tools.  Not as necessary, but useful __if you want grad school letters of reference from me__
6. **LOTS OF GOOD FIELD COURSES!**:  You cannot just take technical and methods courses, or you will have no idea how to do "economics" or whether you really want to.

### Other Courses
At that point, if you take classes outside of economics, focus on things that are interesting to you!

Depending on what you enjoyed, here is a non-exhaustive list of other courses which might expand your interest perspectives.
- **CPSC 322 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)** 
- **CPSC 430 (Computers and Society)**
- **CPSC 320 (Intermediate Algorithm Design and Analysis)**: Core course for 4th year theory, discrete math, etc.
- **CPSC 440 (Advanced Machine Learning)**
- **CPSC 436N (Topics in Natural Language Processing)**: LLMS/etc.
- **CPSC 303 (Numerical Approximation and Discretization)**
- **CPSC 406 (Computational Optimization)**
- **STAT 406 (Methods for Statistical Learning)**-
- **MATH 319 (Introduction to Real Analysis)**: Introduction to Real Analysis:
  - Real analysis is essential math for a large number of applications, and is a good signal to graduate schools of your mathematical sophistication.
  - There is also a class **MATH 320** but I think you probably want to avoid it, as the course is intended more for honours students. If you have background to do well in that class, you won't need the advice of this webpage in the first place
  - Even though **MATH 319** is a more gentle introduction to this material, they still tend to grade these types of courses fairly harshly and you would need to work very hard to get a good grade.
- **MATH 303 (Stochastic Processes)**
- **MATH 307 (Applied Linear Algebra)**
- **MATH 340 (Introduction to Linear Programming)**
- **MATH 341 (Introduction to Discrete Mathematics)**

Again, do not take these sorts of courses instead of economics field courses.  They are essential!
