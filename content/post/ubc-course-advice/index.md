## ECON 407 is the Temporary Course Code for Spring 2023

This is a newly proposed course which will be taught as ECON 407 in Spring 2023  as a pilot.  The prerequisites described below are strongly recommended (or, perhaps, as a corequisite).
## Calendar Description:
(3 credits course) Computational tools used in macroeconomics and financial economics including applications to unemployment, inequality, asset pricing, and economic growth

**Prerequisites**: One of ECON 301, ECON 304, ECON 308 and one of ECON 302, ECON 305, ECON 309 and one of ECON 323, CPSC 103, CPSC 110 and MATH 221

## Course Overview

This is an introductory course in the computational tools used in macroeconomics.

Models in macroeconomics and financial economics are constructed from a core set of tools which help provide a model of individual decisions while still maintaining an internal consistency between the decisions of many individuals in an economy.  Often these models (1) are dynamic and forward looking decisions (e.g. if I consume less today, I can save more for tomorrow); (2) can involve randomness about the future (e.g., if reject a job offer, not sure when the next will occur); (3) have prices which reflect the collective decisions of other agents (e.g., the wage I am offered depends on the availability of other workers); and (4) involve social learning from other agent's through prices (e.g., if many others consider a particular stock a good buy, then the price rises to reflect that information).

While these provide for a rich set of economic theories that can be explored and tested against the data, the inherent difficulty of dynamic models means that many simple models must be solved approximately.

This course will explore these sorts of theoretical models in conjunction with the computational tools to solve and simulate them.  We will learn using the Julia programming language - a modern language for scientific and technical computing which will also help teach a new, high-performance programming language to help build on students Python prerequisites from other courses.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to
1. write software to load and manipulating economic data (LO1)
