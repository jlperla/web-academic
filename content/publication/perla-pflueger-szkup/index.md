abstract: 'We study how frictions originating from the presence of limited liability distort
firms’ investment and financing choices. By financing new investments with
debt, firms can use limited liability to credibly commit to defaulting earlier—
allowing both firms’ owners and new creditors to benefit from diluting existing
creditors. In a dynamic setup, this leads to a time-inconsistency, which increases
the cost of external funds, and discourage investment. We show that the interaction
of these two forces leads to heterogeneous investment distortions where
highly-indebted firms overinvest and those with low levels of debt underinvest.
Allowing direct payments to firms’ owners financed with debt can mitigate overinvestment
but, in the presence of repeated.'
