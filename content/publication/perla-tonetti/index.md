abstract: The least productive agents in an economy can be vital in generating growth
  by spurring technology diffusion. We develop an analytically tractable model in
  which growth is created as a positive externality from risk taking by firms at the
  bottom of the productivity distribution imitating more productive firms. Heterogeneous
  firms choose to produce or pay a cost and search within the economy to upgrade their
  technology. Sustained growth comes from the feedback between the endogenously determined
  distribution of productivity, as evolved from past search decisions, and an optimal,
  forward-looking search policy. The growth rate depends on characteristics of the
  productivity distribution, with a thicker-tailed distribution leading to more growth.
